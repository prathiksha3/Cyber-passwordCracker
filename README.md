Password Cracker using Brute Force attack and Message encryption and decryption

A brute force attack is a way for hackers to try and guess passwords or encryption keys by systematically trying every possible combination until the correct one is found. Imagine you have a lock with a combination code, and someone tries every possible number until the lock opens. That's essentially what a brute force attack does, but with passwords or other secure information.
